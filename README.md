# üåê Name List - SwiftUI Project

Welcome to the Name List SwiftUI App! This project demonstrates how to build a SwiftUI app that displays a list of names. Each name is modeled as a data model using a struct. When you click on a name, an alert with the message "Bonjour, [name]!" is displayed, where `[name]` represents the selected name.

## Project Description

The Name List SwiftUI App is designed to showcase the basic use of SwiftUI Lists and how to respond to user interactions. The app contains a list of names, and when a user taps on any name from the list, an alert appears, displaying a greeting message "Bonjour, [name]!" with the name they selected. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the simplicity and flexibility of SwiftUI when working with lists and responding to user input.
  
## What I Learned

In this project, I focused on the following concepts:

1. **SwiftUI List Creation:** I created a SwiftUI List to display a collection of names.

2. **Data Model with Struct:** I used a Swift struct to define the data model for each name, enabling easy representation and manipulation of the data.

3. **Handling List Item Selection:** I implemented the interaction with the List, allowing users to select a name and trigger an alert.

4. **Displaying Alerts:** I used SwiftUI's native alert functionality to show a customized message based on the selected name.
